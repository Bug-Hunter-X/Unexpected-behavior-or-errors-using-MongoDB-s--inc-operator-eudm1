# MongoDB $inc Operator Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using MongoDB's `$inc` operator. The `$inc` operator is designed to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, using it incorrectly, without proper error handling, can lead to unexpected results. This example highlights how to identify and resolve this issue.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when attempting to increment a field that doesn't exist or isn't a number, leading to unintended consequences. The example showcases an incorrect update operation using the `$inc` operator which may fail silently or produce incorrect results.

## Solution
The solution includes additional checks to handle the cases where the field does not exist or is of an incorrect type, ensuring robust and predictable behavior.  The improved code provides better error handling and prevents unexpected issues during updates.  We implement more robust error checks to prevent unexpected results.
